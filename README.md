The Valorant Eyeball Replacer Addon allows the user to quickly change the default eyes on Valorant characters to those in a selected directory, all inside of Blender.

## Installation

  - Download [valo_eye_replacer.py](https://github.com/maxgoldblatt/ValorantEyeballReplacer/blob/main/valo_eye_replacer.py) from the Valorant Eyeball Replacer Adddon GitHub Repo.

  - Locate an eyeball .blend file of choice to use with the addon. Can be custom made or purchased.
